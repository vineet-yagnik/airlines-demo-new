# Feature Specification: Airlines MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-airlines-mvp`  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an Airlines MVP inspired by transavia.com with home page flight search, results listing, and booking placeholder"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Flight Search Interface (Priority: P1)

A traveler visits the homepage and uses the flight search form to find available flights by entering their travel details including origin, destination, travel dates, and passenger information.

**Why this priority**: This is the core entry point for all flight booking activities. Without a functional search interface, no other features can be used. It represents the minimum viable product that delivers immediate value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the homepage, filling out the search form with valid travel details, and verifying form validation works. Delivers a complete search interface that users can interact with even without results functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the homepage, **When** they see the flight search form, **Then** all required fields (Origin, Destination, Departure Date, Passengers, Cabin) are clearly labeled and accessible
2. **Given** a user fills out the search form with valid details, **When** they submit the form, **Then** they are navigated to the results page with proper URL parameters
3. **Given** a user submits an incomplete form, **When** validation runs, **Then** clear error messages appear with focus management and aria-live announcements
4. **Given** a user toggles between one-way and return options, **When** the toggle changes, **Then** the return date field appears/disappears appropriately with proper focus management

### User Story 2 - Flight Results Display (Priority: P2)

A traveler who has submitted a flight search can view a list of available flights matching their criteria, with clear information about each flight option including times, duration, stops, and pricing.

**Why this priority**: This provides the actual flight data that users need to make booking decisions. Without results, the search functionality is incomplete, but it builds on the foundation of the search interface.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating directly to /results with valid URL parameters and verifying that flight data loads and displays properly. Delivers meaningful flight information for decision-making.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user arrives at the results page with valid search parameters, **When** the page loads, **Then** flight results are displayed as cards showing flight details (times, duration, stops, fare, call-to-action)
2. **Given** the results page is loading flight data, **When** the API call is in progress, **Then** loading status is announced via aria-live regions
3. **Given** no flights match the search criteria, **When** the results load, **Then** a clear "no flights found" message is displayed with suggestions to modify search
4. **Given** a user navigates to the results page, **When** the page loads, **Then** focus is set to the results heading for screen reader accessibility

### User Story 3 - Booking Flow Entry Point (Priority: P3)

A traveler who has found a suitable flight can initiate the booking process by selecting a flight from the results page and accessing the booking interface.

**Why this priority**: This completes the basic user journey from search to booking initiation. While it's a placeholder in this MVP, it establishes the complete flow structure for future development.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking a "Book" button from the results page and verifying navigation to the booking placeholder page. Delivers a complete user journey framework.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing flight results, **When** they click a "Book" button on a flight card, **Then** they are navigated to the booking page for that specific flight
2. **Given** a user lands on the booking page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a clear placeholder indicating booking functionality is coming soon
3. **Given** a user is on the booking page, **When** they want to return to results, **Then** they can navigate back using browser navigation or provided links

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user enters invalid dates (past dates, return before departure)?
- How does the system handle network failures during flight search?
- What occurs when a user manually edits URL parameters to invalid values?
- How does the interface behave on slow network connections?
- What happens when search parameters result in no available flights?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
