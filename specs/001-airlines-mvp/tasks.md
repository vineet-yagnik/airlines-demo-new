# Tasks: Airlines MVP

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-airlines-mvp/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per constitution principle III. Unit tests must be written before implementation for all business logic. Integration tests must verify critical user journeys.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **React Web App**: `src/` for source code, `tests/` or `src/__tests__/` for tests at repository root
- Component structure: `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/services/`, `src/hooks/`
- Assets and styling: `src/assets/`, `src/styles/` or component-scoped CSS modules
- Configuration: Root-level config files (vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, etc.)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Install and configure React Router DOM dependency
- [x] T002 Install and configure Vitest and React Testing Library dependencies  
- [x] T003 [P] Create project directory structure per implementation plan
- [x] T004 [P] Configure Vite for accessibility and performance optimization
- [x] T005 [P] Setup ESLint rules for accessibility (eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Constitutional compliance and foundational tasks:

- [ ] T007 [P] Configure accessibility testing tools (axe-core, jest-axe) in tests/setup.ts
- [ ] T008 [P] Setup performance monitoring (Web Vitals tracking, bundle analysis) in src/lib/performance.ts
- [ ] T009 [P] Configure testing framework (Jest, React Testing Library, coverage) via vite.config.ts
- [ ] T010 [P] Setup responsive grid system and RTL support utilities in src/lib/styles.ts
- [ ] T011 [P] Configure ESLint rules for accessibility and performance in eslint.config.js

- [ ] T015 Create shared Layout component in src/app/Layout.tsx
- [ ] T016 Setup error boundaries for route-level error handling in src/app/ErrorBoundary.tsx

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (MANDATORY) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Types/interfaces before components and utilities
- Utilities before components
- Components before routes
- Core implementation before integration and navigation
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Types and utilities within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for FlightSearch component in src/components/FlightSearch/FlightSearch.test.tsx"
Task: "Integration test for form validation in src/components/FlightSearch/FlightSearch.integration.test.tsx"
Task: "Accessibility test for FlightSearch in src/components/FlightSearch/FlightSearch.a11y.test.tsx"

# Launch all types for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create SearchCriteria type/interface in src/lib/types.ts"
Task: "Create ValidationError type/interface in src/lib/types.ts"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitutional requirements (accessibility, performance, security) built into every task
