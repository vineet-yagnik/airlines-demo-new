# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9.3, React 19.1.1  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite (build tool), React DOM, ESLint (code quality)  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., localStorage, API backend, external services or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: Web application (React SPA)  
**Performance Goals**: LCP ≤2.5s, CLS ≤0.1, FID ≤100ms, bundle ≤200KB gzipped  
**Constraints**: WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, RTL languages  
**Scale/Scope**: Airlines booking interface supporting flight search, selection, and booking flows

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Accessibility-First**: All UI components designed for WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- [ ] **Performance Budgets**: Feature impact on LCP ≤2.5s, CLS ≤0.1, bundle size ≤200KB assessed  
- [ ] **Test-Driven Development**: Unit test strategy defined for business logic, integration tests planned for user journeys
- [ ] **Security by Design**: No client-side secrets planned, input validation strategy defined, secure data handling confirmed
- [ ] **UX Consistency**: Design tokens usage confirmed, responsive grid compliance verified, RTL support considered

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
