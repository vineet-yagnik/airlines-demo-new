# Airlines Booking Demo Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accessibility-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All user interfaces MUST meet WCAG AA standards with keyboard-first navigation and screen reader compatibility. Interactive elements MUST be accessible via keyboard only. Async operations (flight searches, booking confirmations) MUST use aria-live regions for status updates. No visual-only indicators allowed—all information MUST be perceivable through multiple senses.

**Rationale**: Airlines booking affects travelers' essential needs; accessibility ensures equal access regardless of ability, device, or context.

### II. Performance Budgets (NON-NEGOTIABLE)  
Core Web Vitals MUST be enforced: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) ≤ 2.5s, Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) ≤ 0.1, First Input Delay (FID) ≤ 100ms. Bundle size MUST NOT exceed 200KB gzipped for initial load. Critical flight search results MUST render within 1.5s of user input.

**Rationale**: Travel booking is time-sensitive and often happens on mobile networks; performance directly impacts conversion and user satisfaction.

### III. Test-Driven Development
Unit tests MUST be written before implementation for all business logic (booking calculations, validation rules, data transformations). Integration tests MUST verify critical user journeys: search → select → book → confirm. Test coverage MUST exceed 85% for components handling payments, booking logic, and user data.

**Rationale**: Financial transactions and travel arrangements require high reliability; bugs can result in financial loss or travel disruption.

### IV. Security by Design
No secrets or API keys MUST appear in client-side code. All user inputs MUST be validated both client and server-side. Payment processing MUST use secure, encrypted channels with no sensitive data storage. Authentication tokens MUST be properly scoped and expired.

**Rationale**: Airlines booking involves sensitive personal and financial data; security breaches can cause identity theft and financial fraud.

### V. UX Consistency Standards
Design tokens MUST define all colors, typography, spacing, and animation values. Components MUST use a responsive grid system supporting 320px to 1920px viewports. All layouts MUST support RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew). Interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled) MUST be consistently implemented across all components.

**Rationale**: Consistent interfaces reduce cognitive load and support international users; airlines serve diverse global audiences.

## Performance Standards

### Core Web Vitals Enforcement
- **LCP Target**: ≤ 2.5s (measured on 3G networks)
- **CLS Target**: ≤ 0.1 (no layout shifts during critical flows)
- **FID Target**: ≤ 100ms (immediate response to user interactions)
- **Bundle Budget**: Initial load ≤ 200KB gzipped, route chunks ≤ 100KB
- **Image Optimization**: WebP/AVIF formats required, lazy loading for non-critical content
- **Critical Path**: Flight search results rendered within 1.5s of user input

### Monitoring Requirements
Performance metrics MUST be tracked in production using Core Web Vitals API. Automated alerts MUST trigger when metrics exceed thresholds. Performance regression tests MUST be included in CI/CD pipeline.

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Development
- Accessibility audit completed for new components
- Performance impact assessment for new features
- Security review for data handling changes
- Design token compliance verified

### Pre-Deployment  
- All unit and integration tests passing
- Lighthouse accessibility score ≥ 95
- Core Web Vitals within targets
- Security scan passes without high/critical issues
- Cross-browser testing completed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsiveness verified on real devices

### Post-Deployment
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) metrics within targets
- Error rates < 1% for critical flows
- Accessibility compliance verified in production

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and standards. All pull requests MUST include verification of constitutional compliance in the review checklist. Any complexity that violates these principles MUST be explicitly justified with business impact and mitigation plans.

Architecture decisions contradicting these principles require team consensus and documented risk acceptance. Regular constitutional reviews MUST occur quarterly to ensure principles remain relevant and achievable.

Performance budgets and accessibility standards are NON-NEGOTIABLE and cannot be compromised for delivery timelines. If compliance cannot be achieved, scope MUST be reduced rather than standards lowered.
